				Welcome to the Main Page!

			<p>
				These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange
				new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone 
				before. We need to neutralize the homing signal. Each unit has total environmental control, 
				gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, in a protective field. Sensors show energy readings 
				in your area. We had a forced chamber explosion in the resonator coil. Field strength has 
				increased by 3,000 percent.

			<p>
				It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves. The cerebellum, the
				cerebral cortex, the brain stem,  the entire nervous system has been depleted of 
				electrochemical energy. Any device like that would produce high levels of triolic waves. These
				walls have undergone some kind of selective molecular polarization. I haven't determined if our
				phaser energy can generate a stable field. We could alter the photons with phase discriminators.
			</p>

			<p>
				Communication is not possible. The shuttle has no power. Using the gravitational pull of a star
				to slingshot back in time? We are going to Starbase Montgomery for Engineering consultations 
				prompted by minor read-out anomalies. Probes have recorded unusual levels of geological activity
				in all five planetary systems. Assemble a team. Look at records of the Drema quadrant. Would 
				these scans detect artificial transmissions as well as natural signals?
			</p>

			<p>
				Exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit. We have begun power-supply calibration. Force fields
				have been established on all turbo lifts and crawlways. Computer, run a level-two diagnostic on 
				warp-drive systems. Antimatter containment positive. Warp drive within normal parameters. I read
				an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escape pod. The bomb had a molecular-decay detonator. 
				Detecting some unusual fluctuations in subspace frequencies.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now what are the possibilities of warp drive? Cmdr Riker's nervous system has been invaded by 
				an unknown microorganism. The organisms fuse to the nerve, intertwining at the molecular level.
				That's why the transporter's biofilters couldn't extract it. The vertex waves show a K-complex
				corresponding to an REM state. The engineering section's critical. Destruction is imminent. Their
				robes contain ultritium, highly explosive, virtually undetectable by your transporter.
			</p>

			<p>
				I have reset the sensors to scan for frequencies outside the usual range. By emitting harmonic 
				vibrations to shatter the lattices. We will monitor and adjust the frequency of the resonators.
				He has this ability of instantly interpreting and extrapolating any verbal communication he 
				hears. It may be due to the envelope over the structure, causing hydrogen-carbon helix patterns
				throughout. I'm comparing the molecular integrity of that bubble against our phasers.
