	You enjoyed that. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. The unexpected is our normal routine. Talk about going nowhere fast. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Computer, lights up! Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Besides, you look good in a dress. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Your shields were failing, sir. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Your head is not an artifact! Not if I weaken first. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. I'll be sure to note that in my log. Damage report! Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. They were just sucked into space. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. How long can two people talk about nothing? I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! I am your worst nightmare! I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet.
