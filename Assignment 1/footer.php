We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable piece of 
bio-electronic engineering by which I see much of the EM spectrum ranging from heat 
and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and forgive me if I've said and listened
to this a thousand times. This planet's interior heat provides an abundance of 
geothermal energy. We need to neutralize the homing signal.

Exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit. We have begun power-supply calibration. Force
fields have been established on all turbo lifts and crawlways. Computer, run a level-two
diagnostic on warp-drive systems. Antimatter containment positive. Warp drive within 
normal parameters. I read an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escape pod. The bomb
had a molecular-decay detonator. Detecting some unusual fluctuations in subspace frequencies.

Communication is not possible. The shuttle has no power. Using the gravitational pull of a
star to slingshot back in time? We are going to Starbase Montgomery for Engineering 
consultations prompted by minor read-out anomalies. Probes have recorded unusual levels 
of geological activity in all five planetary systems. Assemble a team. Look at records 
of the Drema quadrant. Would these scans detect artificial transmissions as well as 
natural signals?

Shields up. I recommend we transfer power to phasers and arm the photon torpedoes. 
Something strange on the detector circuit. The weapons must have disrupted our 
communicators. You saw something as tasty as meat, but inorganically materialized out
of patterns used by our transporters. Captain, the most elementary and valuable 
statement in science, the beginning of wisdom, is 'I do not know.' All transporters off.
